# Musync: Product Requirements Document
=====================================================

## 1. Product Overview

Musync is a cross-platform playlist management application that synchronizes music playlists across multiple streaming services. The application allows users to import, create, and manage playlists that automatically sync between connected music platforms, initially supporting Spotify and YouTube Music, with a distinctive retro interface inspired by CRT monitors and arcade games.

**Status: Core concept implemented with retro UI and authentication system**

## 2. Target Users

- Music enthusiasts who use multiple streaming platforms
- Playlist curators who want to maintain consistent collections across services
- Users frustrated with platform lock-in for their music collections
- Individuals with nostalgic appreciation for retro computing aesthetics

**Status: Target audience remains unchanged**

## 3. Core Features & Functional Requirements

### 3.1 User Authentication & Profile Management

- Users must be able to create accounts using email or OAuth with Spotify/Google ✅
- System shall support connecting multiple streaming service accounts to a single profile ⚠️
- Users must be able to view and manage connected services in their profile ✅
- Profile shall display statistics about playlists, tracks, and synchronization activity ⚠️

**Status: Authentication system is functional with both credential and Spotify OAuth login. Profile management is basic but operational. Google OAuth and comprehensive statistics need completion.**

### 3.2 Playlist Import & Management

- System must allow importing existing playlists from Spotify ⚠️
- System must allow importing existing playlists from YouTube Music ❌
- Users must be able to create new playlists directly in Musync ⚠️
- System shall support editing playlist details (name, description, cover image) ⚠️
- System must allow adding/removing tracks from playlists ⚠️
- System must support playlist deletion with confirmation ⚠️

**Status: Basic playlist management functionality exists, but full import/export capabilities are still in development.**

### 3.3 Cross-Platform Synchronization

- All playlists created or imported must automatically sync to connected platforms ❌
- System must maintain playlist integrity across platforms by matching equivalent tracks ❌
- Synchronization must occur bidirectionally (changes on any platform reflect everywhere) ❌
- System shall provide visual indication of synchronization status for each playlist ⚠️
- Synchronization errors must be logged and presented to users with recovery options ❌

**Status: Core synchronization functionality is still in development. The infrastructure for connecting to platforms exists, but the actual synchronization logic needs more work.**

### 3.4 Search & Discovery

- Users must be able to search for tracks across all connected platforms ⚠️
- System shall provide unified search results from multiple platforms ⚠️
- System must allow adding search results directly to playlists ❌

**Status: Basic search functionality exists but needs refinement. The mock implementation for YouTube Music search is in place, but real API integration needs to be completed.**

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance

- Playlist synchronization should complete within 30 seconds for playlists up to 100 tracks ⚠️
- UI interactions must respond within 200ms ✅
- Application should load initial content within 2 seconds ✅

**Status: Basic performance requirements are met, but synchronization performance needs optimization.**

### 4.2 Security

- User authentication tokens must be encrypted at rest and in transit ✅
- Application must implement token refresh procedures ⚠️
- Personal data must be protected according to GDPR standards ✅
- Application must use HTTPS for all communications ✅

**Status: Core security requirements are implemented, but token refresh logic needs refinement.**

### 4.3 Usability

- Interface must be usable on devices from 320px width to desktop sizes ✅
- Application must provide clear feedback for all user actions ✅
- Error messages must be user-friendly and actionable ✅

**Status: Usability requirements are largely met with the current implementation.**

### 4.4 Reliability

- System must handle API rate limits gracefully ⚠️
- Synchronization must recover automatically from temporary failures ❌
- Data consistency must be maintained across service disruptions ⚠️

**Status: Reliability features need more development, particularly around error recovery and handling API limitations.**

## 5. User Interface Requirements

### 5.1 Visual Design

- Interface must implement a retro CRT monitor aesthetic with: ✅
  - Phosphor glow effects (green text on dark background) ✅
  - Subtle scan lines across the interface ✅
  - Slight screen curvature simulation ✅
  - Pixel-style typography using retro computer fonts ✅
  - "Electron burn" effects for static elements ✅

**Status: Visual design requirements are fully implemented with a consistent retro CRT aesthetic.**

### 5.2 Navigation Structure

- Main navigation must include: Home, Playlists, Profile, Search ✅
- Playlists view must include filtering options by platform ⚠️
- Detail views must show all metadata and sync status ⚠️

**Status: Basic navigation structure is in place, but some filtering and detail views need refinement.**

### 5.3 Key Screens

- Landing/Home Page: Features explanation and login/signup ✅
- Playlist Library: Grid/list of all user playlists with platform indicators ✅
- Playlist Detail: Track listing with platform availability indicators ⚠️
- Profile Page: Connected services and synchronization statistics ✅
- Import Interface: Service selection and playlist browser ⚠️

**Status: Most key screens are implemented, but some need additional functionality.**

## 6. Technical Requirements & Constraints

### 6.1 Platform & Compatibility

- Application must be built with Next.js framework ✅
- Frontend must be responsive and support modern browsers (last 2 versions) ✅
- Mobile experience must be fully functional ✅

**Status: Platform and compatibility requirements are met.**

### 6.2 API Dependencies

- Spotify Web API integration with OAuth 2.0 authentication ✅
- YouTube Data API v3 integration with Google OAuth ⚠️
- MongoDB database for data persistence ✅

**Status: Core API integrations are in place, but YouTube API integration needs completion.**

### 6.3 Limitations

- YouTube Music lacks official API; system must use YouTube Data API as proxy ⚠️
- Track matching across platforms may not achieve 100% accuracy ❌
- API rate limits may restrict synchronization frequency ⚠️
- Some platform-specific features may not be replicable ⚠️

**Status: Known limitations are being addressed, but more work is needed on track matching and handling API constraints.**

## 7. Next Steps

1. Complete YouTube Music API integration
2. Implement full bidirectional synchronization logic
3. Improve track matching algorithm
4. Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Complete playlist management features
6. Implement comprehensive testing for synchronization edge cases
7. Optimize performance for large playlists
8. Add user feedback mechanisms for synchronization issues

**Status: The project has a solid foundation with authentication, database integration, and UI implementation. The focus should now be on completing the core synchronization functionality and refining the playlist management features.**
